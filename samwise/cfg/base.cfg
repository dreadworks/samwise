#   Basic samwise configuration file
#   Syntax is defined in http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:4/ZPL
#   Make sure to indent with 4 spaces.
#
#
#   Special formats used:
#
#     TIME PREFIX:
#
#       [0-9]+[Msmhd]
#
#       M -> Milliseconds
#       s -> Seconds
#       m -> Minutes
#       h -> Hours
#       d -> Days
#
#     BINARY PREFIX:
#
#       Provide a value x > 0 with a binary prefix:
#       [0-9]+[BKMG]{0,1}
#
#       If the binary prefix is missing, the value is read as B. The
#       buffer size s is then calculated by multiplying according to the
#       prefix: s = x * 1024^p, where p = 0, 1, 2, 3 for B, K M, G,
#       respectively.
