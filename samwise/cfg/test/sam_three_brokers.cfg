    # amount of time (retries/threshold).

    # BUFFER SIZE (currently unused)
    # Provide a value x > 0 with a binary prefix:
    # [0-9]+[BKMG]{0,1}
    #
    # If the binary prefix is missing, the value is read as B. The
    # buffer size s is then calculated by multiplying according to the

    # respectively.
