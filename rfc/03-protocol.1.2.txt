SAMWISE RFC 02 - PROTOCOL VERSION 1.1

name: 03-protocol.1.2


ABSTRACT

  This is an extension of the samwise protocol 1.0 and 1.1 described
  in rfc 1 and rfc 2. It defines how control commands are
  modeled. They are mainly used by samctl but users may implement their
  own control programs.


  All types correspond to the c types used by libzmq and czmq.

GOALS

  - Define a format for sending control commands

  - Define the possible control commands



REPLY MESSAGES FROM SAMWISE

  The behavior described in rfc 1 is changed such that clients can
  always expect to receive two frames where the second frame may be
  an empty string.



FORMAT FOR CONTROL COMMANDS

  The format for control commands is relatively simple:

      property                type        value
  0 | protocol version      | integer   | x >= 120
  1 | action                | char *    | "publish" or
  2 | argument count        | integer   | x >= 0
  3 | argument 1            | char *    | -
  ...
  x | argument x            | char *    | -

  For argument count == 0, only the first two frames must be provided.



DEFINED CONTROL COMMANDS

  Currently the following commands are supported:

    - "ping" : If successful, clients receive a 0 return code

    - "status" : If successful, clients receive a 0 return code and a
      string containing additional information about the internal
      state.

    - "stop" : Orders samd to shutdown. When the client receives the
      answer, samd might still be shutting down.

    - "restart" : Orders samd to restart. This reloads the
      configuration without re-binding the public endpoint.
